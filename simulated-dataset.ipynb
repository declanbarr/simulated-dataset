    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The real-world phenomenom that I will be looking at is the relationship between all-cause mortality and either obesity or underweight. Obesity grades 2 and 3 (BMI >/= 35) is associated with an aproximate 30% increase in all-cause mortality compared to normal weight (Ref - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4855514/). Underweight is associated with a 37% increase in all-cause mortality compared to normal weight (Ref - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4021191/). All-cause mortality is any cause of death, not just those caused by the specific condition being examined (in this case obesity or underweight) ( Ref - https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-is-all-cause-mortality-2223349). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Underweight is associated with an increase in mortality due to external factors such as drug and alcohol abuse, smoking and fraility, with smoking being a particular risk factor (Ref - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4021191/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset can be used to predict the number of people in a population that will suffer from obesity or underweight and therefore an increase in all-cause mortality."

    "* Weight (continuous)\n",
    "* Height (continuous)\n",

However due to the fact that BMI is calculated from weight/ height^2, the BMI differences between males and females is small (27.5 for males compared to 26.4 for females) (Ref - https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/46a7ad27/files/uploaded/The%20National%20Adult%20Nutrition%20Survey%20%282008-2010%29.pdf)\n",
